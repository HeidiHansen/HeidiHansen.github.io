I’m an iOS and Android software engineer, currently based in Amsterdam. I have been consulting remotely and internationally, with clients ranging from university entrepreneurs to government-funded digital identity verification providers. I attended the Flatiron School in NYC to study iOS Software Development, MIT's Fabrication Academy to study digital fabrication, and Udacity to study Android App development. Before moving to Amsterdam, I led the Boston Code Dojo MeetUp, a language agnostic algorithm challenge group, for 2 years.

I'm looking for a full-time position, **remote**, with partial US-day overlap possible. 

To name just a few technologies I'm experienced with: Android, iOS, Objective-C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, UI, UX, Git, autolayout, accessibility, privacy, mobile security, native apps.

Before getting into tech I lived a very different life full of problem solving. I designed and built an off-grid house from salvaged materials, in a roadless valley on a sparsely populated island in Hawai'i that I lived in for four years. Since then, I've enjoyed exploring the world by bicycle, and I’m usually nerding out about fermented foods, primitive skills, ethnobotany, and sustainability.

Whether it's a mobile app, a startup idea, a bicycle, or an an off-grid homestead, I enjoy the process of planning and creating ambitious ideas.  Specifically, I love collaborating with kind and fun people to develop efficient and useful products to improve lives.  

I’m a strong mobile developer with experience leading teams, and expect to be programming for a few more years. I've done lots of product/project management, and would love a Junior Product Designer/Manager role where I can perfect my skills in this area. I want to be involved in architecture design, train other developers in best practices, help improve technical hiring, and use my rounded skill set to create well built products.

I'm looking for a position where I can have the opportunity to use my user-centric product development skills, and dream of working for a company whose mission I firmly believe in. I look for jobs about which I am passionate because this allows me to be extremely productive and creative, but also gives me the opportunity to grow.
